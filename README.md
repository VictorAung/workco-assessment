# Work & Co Web Code Assessment

This is a copy of the [Redux Shopping Cart Example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart).

To install dependencies, use the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```
yarn
```

To start a development server:

```
yarn start
```

## Setup

Please create a new, public Github repository where your assessment can be reviewed. We recommend the following steps:

- Create a repository on your personal Github. Make sure the `Initialize this repository with a README` box is unchecked.
- Visit your new repository. Copy the `â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line` code provided and run it in your terminal in the same directory as this README file. It will look something like this:

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:my-username/my-assessment.git
git push -u origin master
```

Note: You're encouraged to show your work by including multiple commits - we'll be looking through your git history.

## Tasks

1. [Implement Responsive Design](/tasks/01-responsive-design.md)
2. [Enhance Cart Functionality](/tasks/02-cart-enhancements.md)
3. [Hook Up Product API](/tasks/03-product-api.md)

You're welcome (but not required) to add any libraries you think would be helpful.

Please also update this README file: we'd love to see notes on your decision-making process, links to the most exciting pieces of code, or anything else that will give us additional context when reviewing your assessment.

## Task 1: Implement Responsive design

First things first, actually implement the given sketch into code! As it states in the instructions, it should be responsive and not adaptive. Looking at the breakpoints though, the mobile implementation is slightly different - the image appears on the top of the card rather than on the left and the shopping cart link is in a different place so that's something to note. For that reason, I focused on implementing the desktop/tablet version first.

1. Export assets from Sketch file.
