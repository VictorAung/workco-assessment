# Work & Co Web Code Assessment

This is a copy of the [Redux Shopping Cart Example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart).

To install dependencies, use the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```

To start a development server:

```
yarn start

## Setup

Please create a new, public Github repository where your assessment can be reviewed. We recommend the following steps:

- Create a repository on your personal Github. Make sure the `Initialize this repository with a README` box is unchecked.
- Visit your new repository. Copy the `â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line` code provided and run it in your terminal in the same directory as this README file. It will look something like this:

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:my-username/my-assessment.git
git push -u origin master
```

Note: You're encouraged to show your work by including multiple commits - we'll be looking through your git history.

## Tasks

1. [Implement Responsive Design](/tasks/01-responsive-design.md)
2. [Enhance Cart Functionality](/tasks/02-cart-enhancements.md)
3. [Hook Up Product API](/tasks/03-product-api.md)

You're welcome (but not required) to add any libraries you think would be helpful.

Please also update this README file: we'd love to see notes on your decision-making process, links to the most exciting pieces of code, or anything else that will give us additional context when reviewing your assessment.

## Task 1: Implement Responsive design

First things first, actually implement the given sketch into code! As it states in the instructions, it should be responsive and not adaptive.

1. I'm on a Windows machine so I don't have the Helvetica Neue Font, sorry about that! As far as I can see though, it's only used in a handful of places. I continue to use Chivo instead.

2. I tried to make the project as Responsive as possible so for things like the "Acme Store" header, I use a minimum of 26px font added to a 2vw scaling factor. This means that "Acme Store" scales linearly with screen width but it also means it's not exactly accurate to the Breakpoints. Based off the task explanation though, I felt that it was more important to have responsive text that captures the essence of the sketch rather than follow the sketch exactly to a tee.

3. That being said, there are exceptions that I handled on a case by case basis. The price of the items are 21px in Breakpoints 1 and 2 despite having different widths. The price of the items in Breakpoint 3 is 16px so I handled that adaptively rather than responsive because the sketch file made it clear that that particular piece of text should not scale linearly with width.
